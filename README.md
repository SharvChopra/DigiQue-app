DigiQue is a full-stack, dual-portal web application designed to modernize and streamline the medical appointment process. It provides a user-friendly platform for patients to discover nearby hospitals and book appointments in real-time. It also features a comprehensive dashboard for hospital administrators to manage their doctors, schedules, appointments, and public-facing profiles.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This application is split into two main portals, each with its own set of features.

### Patient Portal

* **Secure Authentication:** Patients can register, log in, and manage their own accounts.
* **Geolocation-based Search:** On the homepage, the app automatically fetches the user's location to display a list of nearby hospitals, sorted by proximity.
* **Hospital Discovery:** Patients can browse all listed hospitals, view their detailed public profiles (including banner images, logos, 'About' sections, and lists of services).
* **Doctor Discovery:** On a hospital's detail page, patients can see a list of all doctors associated with that hospital, including their specialty and profile picture.
* **Real-Time Booking:**
    * Patients can click "Book Appointment" on a doctor.
    * A modal appears, allowing them to select a date.
    * The app makes a real-time API call to fetch available time slots for that specific doctor on that day.
    * This availability is dynamically generated based on the doctor's schedule (set by the admin) and any appointments that are already booked.
* **Appointment Management:** A dedicated "My Appointments" page with a calendar view. Patients can see all their upcoming and past appointments, click a date to see details, and have the option to reschedule or cancel.
* **Personal Settings:** Patients can update their personal profile (name, email, phone) and securely change their password.

### Hospital Admin Portal

* **Secure Role-Based Authentication:** A separate login for users with a "HOSPITAL" role.
* **Overview Dashboard:** An at-a-glance homepage showing key statistics, such as "Today's Appointments," "Upcoming Appointments," and "Total Doctors Listed."
* **Doctor Management (Full CRUD):**
    * **Add:** Add new doctors to the hospital's roster.
    * **Edit:** Update a doctor's name, specialty, and profile image URL.
    * **Delete:** Remove a doctor from the roster.
* **Dynamic Schedule Management:**
    * An "Edit Schedule" modal for each doctor.
    * Set availability (isAvailable, startTime, endTime) for all 7 days of the week.
    * Set a specific `appointmentDuration` (e.g., 15, 30, 45 minutes) which is used to generate the patient-facing time slots.
* **Appointment Management:**
    * View a complete list of all appointments booked for their hospital.
    * Filter appointments by date and/or by doctor.
    * **Update Status:** Mark appointments as "Completed" or "Cancelled."
* **Hospital Profile Management:**
    * Edit the hospital's entire public-facing profile.
    * Update basic info (name, address, contact).
    * Update the "About" description and the list of "Services Offered."
    * Update the **Banner Image URL** and **Logo URL** to control how the hospital appears on the patient's discovery page.
* **Admin Account Settings:**
    * Admins can update their *own* personal user account (first name, last name, email).
    * A separate, secure form to change their own login password.
